## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
We have a good balance of skills in the team.
### Weaknesses:
Working in a group for the first time will be a challenge but communication will be key.
### Opportunities:
It will be a good experience with co-coding and working with multiple branchs, etc in Github.
### Threats:
If communication is poor, the team will suffer.
